# 🧠 Tensor and TensorFlow Proficiency Demonstration

This repository is designed to demonstrate practical knowledge of **Tensors** and **TensorFlow**, one of the most popular open-source machine learning libraries developed by Google.

## 🔍 Overview

This project includes:

- Tensor fundamentals: creation, types, shapes, indexing, broadcasting, and reshaping.
- Tensor operations: arithmetic, linear algebra, slicing, reshaping, and reduction operations.
- Gradient computation using `tf.GradientTape`.
- GPU utilization and tensor device placement.
- Simple neural network model built using the TensorFlow `keras` API.
- Custom training loop with manual gradient application.

Each concept is demonstrated through clean, commented Python scripts and notebooks.
